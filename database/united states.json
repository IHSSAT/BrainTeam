The fourth-place candidate in this election was the man who earlier suppresssed the Portland Rum Riot and promoted the Maine Law, Prohibitionist Neal Dow, while the leading third-party candidate in this election, running for the first time, was the great-grandfather of Dennis the Menace creator Hank Ketcham. One candidate in this election became prominent for taking a light hand as the commander of the military occupation of Texas and Louisiana. That candidate's supporters in this election blanketed the nation with graffiti and signs bearing the number \"329,\" representing the number of dollars that the winning candidate received from Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Mobilier. The winner of this election, who defeated both the Democratic candidate and third-party challenger James Weaver, ran the original \"front porch campaign\" after surviving convention strife between the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds. However, that infighting came back to haunt the winner of this election, who heard the declaration \"I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts and Arthur is President now\" just nine months after taking office.
